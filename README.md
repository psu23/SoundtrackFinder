              ###**What is Youjuke?**###

                Youjuke is a music forum that allows groups of visitors to compile
                a shared playlist and listen to it together, live. Anyone can add a track
                to the playlist, but it is up to all users as a whole to decide the order of the
                playlist. Whether you want to share tracks with a larger audience,
                or want to break out into a virtual party with friends, Youjuke has you covered.

              Want to know which music the audience likes? Youjuke keeps track of the user
                music preferences and favorite tracks. Want to have a virtual karaoke party
                while video chatting with friends? Just select the lyrics tab and sing away.

            Motivation behind developing Youjuke
              * Virtual listening parties with friends or strangers
              * More meaningful music recommendations from others rather than algorithms
              * Sharing experiences remotely

              Let you be the algorithm to your listening party.

              

              ###**How do I use Youjuke?**###

              
                * In this demo version of Youjuke, some tracks may already be in the playlist.
                * If there are already tracks queued up in the player or playlist, click on the play button to start the music. If there are no songs in the playlist, search for a song and click on it to add to the playlist.
                * Want to hear that song you just added more than any of the others already in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs up to vote up its position.  If that song has more
                  has more thumbs-ups than the other tracks, it will come on after the current song. 
                * Hate a song in the playlist? Give that song a thumbs down. The most down-voted songs will appear at the bottom of the playlist after the current song ends.
                * In this demo version, you have unlimited voting, but users will have
                  limited votes per amount of songs that are added to the playlist.
                * Want to sing along to the current song? The tab next to the search tab shows lyrics of the current song.
                * There are graph tabs that show charts of music preferences of users and lists of 
                  favorite tracks of both you and other users.
